Telepresence can connect to a cluster and route all outbound traffic from your
workstation to that cluster so that software running locally can communicate
as if it executed remotely, inside the cluster. This is achieved using the
command:

telepresence connect

Telepresence can also intercept traffic intended for a specific service in a
cluster and redirect it to your local workstation:

telepresence intercept <name of service>

Telepresence uses background processes to manage the cluster session. One of
the processes runs with superuser privileges because it modifies the network.
Unless the daemons are already started, an attempt will be made to start them.
This will involve a call to sudo unless this command is run as root (not
recommended) which in turn may result in a password prompt.

  telepresence [command]
